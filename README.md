CRISPR are a family of related genes that function as a defense system in prokaryotes against phages and plasmid DNA.

#### Definitions

**Prokaryotes** are unicellular organisms that lack organelles or other internal membrane-bound structures. Therefore, they do not have a nucleus, but, instead, generally have a single chromosome: a piece of circular, double-stranded DNA located in an area of the cell called the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes have a cell wall outside the plasma membrane.
